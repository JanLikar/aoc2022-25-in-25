# 2022 Advent of Code - 25 days in 25 languages

- [01 - Python](#1-python)
- [02 - Clojure](#2-clojure)
- [03 - Elixir](#3-elixir)
- [04 - C](#4-c)
- [05 - PHP](#5-php)

In each of the languages I tried to follow the best practices to the best of my knowledge.
I am, however, familiar with only a handful of them, so don't hold it against me if I butchered them colossally.

## 25 Days
### 1. Python
I figured I would start with something I'm actually familiar with.

What can I say... Python is my primary language and I love it dearly, so this was not a challenge at all.

Python is an excelent fit for solving tasks like these.

### 2. Clojure
As I don't have any real-world experience with lisps, I expected a decent Clojure solution would be harder for me to implement.

I was pleasently surprised - Clojure proved extremely expressive and nice to work with.

Converting my first PoC, which looked fairly similar to what an imperative solution would look like,
to a more idiomatic, functional solution was thoroughly rewarding.

### 3. Elixir
In a way this felt like Clojure with a different syntax.

String handling was slightly awkward, but I am sure that's because I didn't take enough time
to learn about Elixir's string types.

This task does not really allow Elixir's killer features to shine, but it was still a decent fit.

### 4. C
I haven't had the pleasure of using C in a long time. It felt a bit like cheating to use
it for such a simple task that would have been easy in any of the languages on my list (short of assembly).

Having said that, I would rather save the languages I am less familiar with for more interesting tasks.

### 5. PHP
PHP was my first programming language and I used to adore it. 
Its low barrier to entry showed me what programming is and opened me doors into the wonderful world of computer engineering.

Solving this task, however, was no fun at all.

Array and string handling is awkward, syntax sugar you would expect to have in a high-level programming language is simply missing,
semantics of some basic language constructs are unclear...

Unless I was trying to cobble together a quick-and-dirty website I would actually prefer to use C over PHP.
